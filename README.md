# Mart
I have temporarily used random images as I couldn't straightforwardly access media.redmart.com, tagged as unsafe connection. I have already modified info.plist to allow it, to no avail. But I imagine it shouldn't be a problem on your company's network, so kindly --

        //uncomment to load actual images from API

        //cell.photo.load(url: URL(string: self.productList![indexPath.row].productImageUrl)!)


        //uncomment to load actual images from API

        //self.productImageView.load(url: URL(string: (self.item?.productImageUrl)!)!)
